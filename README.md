# 42PiscineCode
Some C code I made for 42 Silicon Valley

1. AlphaSquare.c
This program takes in x and y dimensions and outputs a square shape surrounded by letters. Dimensions depend on
X and Y values.

2. ft_putstr.c
mimicks putstr function in c

3. ft_strupcase.c
this function takes in charecter string and converts all charecters to capital case

4. match.c
takes an input of 2 strings and sees if they match. A '\*' can be any string. This is a wildcard matching problem solved with recursion.
