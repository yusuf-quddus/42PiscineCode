# 42PiscineCode

The purpose of this function is to find out whether two strings match.

1 and s2 are considered to match when s1 and s2 are identical.

If s2 contains a star (’*’), we can replace this star by any characters string (even empty) to make s1 and s2 identical.

s2 may hold as many stars as you’d like.

For example, "main.c" and "\*.c" match because it is possible to replace ’*’ by
  the string "main" to render those two strings identical.
